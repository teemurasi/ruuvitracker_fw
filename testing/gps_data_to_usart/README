This is a skeleton project for ChibiOS on RuuviTracker REVA board

Project setup
==============

The default cross-compiler prefix is arm-none-eabi- which matches the
Mentor Graphics Sourcery G++ (former CodeSourcery) toolchain. This can
be changed by adjusting the TRGT variable in the Makefile.

Change the Makefile using an existing ChibiOS demo as an example.

Modify the CHIBIOS variable in the makefile to tell the location of
your local ChibiOS repository. e.g. /home/username/eclipse_workspace/chibios/ver_2.4.0
or more handy could be to use shorter symbolic link

Different versions of ChibiOS may or may not work, version 2.4.0 was
used to setup this skeleton project.

ChibiOS sources can be downloaded from the ChibiOS site at

 http://www.chibios.org/

Building
=========

 $ make
